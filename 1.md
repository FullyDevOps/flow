## Next (if you want even more) 🔧

I can add:

1. **ERD diagram** (tables/entities) for a compliance database (Lots, COAs, Shipments, Claims, Labels, Suppliers).
2. **Mind-map** diagrams for “Documentation Binder Structure.”
3. **Sub-process diagrams per SKU** (orange peel vs whole, lemon peel vs juice solids) including label impacts.

Say: **“Generate ERD + binder mind-maps”** and I’ll output those Mermaid blocks.
